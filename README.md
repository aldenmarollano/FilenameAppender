This webapp determines the dimension of a jpeg/jpg image in feet(ft) and inches(in).
The calculation is based on the exifdata of the image.
It accepts only jpg/jpeg image type. Images which sources came from AI images cannot be converted as they do not have the exifdata for dimension, and will be counted as ignored file.
This webapp is made to automate the appending of dimension on the filename of bulk images for printing. As per requirement of Printing Shop(s), all files should have the dimension details on the filename.
